= EduWiki =
EduWiki is a prototype for an experimental system that creates custom lesson plans and assessments from wikipedia articles and other web resources using a combination of machine and crowd intelligence.

== Tools Used ==

Eduwiki uses Python for its API handling code, Django for its app structure, and Twitter Bootstrap 3.0 for its styling. It uses a modified version of the Wikipedia library to wrap the MediaWiki API, Beautiful Soup 4 for some assorted HTML parsing tasks, and the Python Requests library. It is currently in active prototype development and research at Carnegie Mellon University.
